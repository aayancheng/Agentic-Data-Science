You are Codex. Plan the end-to-end work for 3 datasets (Fraud, NYC Taxi, IMDb) to produce:
1) EDA + baseline models in notebooks
2) A FastAPI backend with /api endpoints for scoring/inference
3) A Vite React UI with three tabs to demo each dataset

Deliverables:
- A markdown workplan with milestones, task DAG, and file-level CRUD actions.
- For each dataset, propose features, evaluation metrics, and acceptance criteria.
- Identify where to use imbalanced learning (Fraud), time series cross-val (Taxi), and NLP pipeline (IMDb).

HITL approvals: licensing checks, model acceptance thresholds, and PR reviews.
